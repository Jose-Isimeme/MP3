## Emily Feller and Jose Isimeme
Participation Breakdown

Emily: Worked on server code, created Makefile, wrote README, created test document

Jose:

## How to Run the Program
- use the make file to build the server with "make server"
- run the code by calling the echos binary (not sure why it called it echos rather than server) along with the ip address and port number "./echos <ip> <port>"
  - Can use "hostname -I" to get local ip address to use
- create a new window and run "tftp"
- connect to the server by calling "connect <ip> <port>
- can change the mode by calling either binary or netascii
- use a "get" command to get a file using tftp
